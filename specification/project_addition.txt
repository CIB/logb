Problem: We have a relation of the sort

addition(x, y, z)

where the rule holds iff x + y = z

We want to list possible results for

find x in addition(x, 5, 8)

We can add an unverified rule:

assume
    addition(x, y, z)
then maybe
    x = z - y
end

We can instantiate the rule:

x = 8 - 5

Which immediately yields us a result:

x <- 8 - 5

The query can also be evaluated using a search tree and axioms:

assume
    a + b = c
then
    a = c - b
end

x + y = z

=>

x = z - y

At which point we have a direct result for x
