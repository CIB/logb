# Okay, so what's the problem..
# Essentially, we get a sequence of "high-level" operations, like add sprite, move sprite, rotate sprite, redraw, etc.
# We then convert this sequence to a sequence of low-level operations, such as draw pixel, draw line, redraw, etc.
# For this conversion we assert that after each high level redraw operation, the canvas of the high level interface must
# be equivalent to the canvas of the low level interface after the corresponding low level redraw operation
# Hence, our reasoning system can figure out which low level operations to do, to match the incoming high level operations

# For ease of use, we represent "redraw" operations as ends of lists
# So say you have a list [[Create Sprite, Move Sprite], [Move Sprite]], then the first refresh would happen after the end
# of the first list, the second refresh would happen after the end of the second list.
# Likewise for low level operations.

process:
- specify what high-level and low-level operations do
- give an input, give the system constraints on the output (including constraints depending on the input)
- have the system compute a possible solution for the output
	- make it a GOOD solution
